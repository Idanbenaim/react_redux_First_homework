# Login Process using React Redux

This is a simple login process using React and Redux. The process involves entering a username and password, and then clicking a button to either log in or log out. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. 

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

## Components

There are two components involved in the login process:

### Login

This component handles the actual login process. It contains a button that switches between "Log in" and "Log out" based on whether the user is currently logged in or not. When the button is clicked, it dispatches a Redux action to update the login state.

### LoginWrapper

This component contains the username and password fields and the Login component. It handles the onLogin callback and displays a message in the console when the user logs out.

## Redux

The login state is managed using Redux. There is a loginSlice file that contains the login logic, and the store file configures the Redux store.

## Conclusion

That's it! This is a simple login process using React and Redux. If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know.
